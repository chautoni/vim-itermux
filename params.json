{"name":"vim-itermux","body":"iTermux is a port of the Turbux plugin written by Josh Davey.\r\n\r\niTermux is designed to speed up your TDD cycle by using a single key\r\nmapping to run the most relevant test based on the current file in vim.\r\nIt uses iTerm2's scriptability to send commands to a chosen session in your\r\niTerm window.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the documentation, or the [introductory video](http://vimeo.com/welaika/itermux).\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis plugin has no required dependencies, but becomes really awesome when used\r\nwith rails.vim. It also makes the assumption that you're using iTerm on\r\na Mac platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nUse tpope's pathogen.","tagline":"Turbo Ruby testing with iTerm","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
